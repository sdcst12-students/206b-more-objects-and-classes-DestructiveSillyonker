## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Parameters and Return Values with Class Methods

Objectives 
* get more practice creating class methods
* make use of input (parameters/arguments) and output (return values) for classes
* adding color to text in Python using Ansi escape codes

One of the most important uses of a class method/function is use of input values as well as output/return values.  Remember that a class method must always contain "self" as its first positional argument, and that it does not count as one:

Consider the code in example1.py
Answer the questions provided in the attached Google Document
1. How many class methods does this class use?
2. What is the purpose of the class method on line 26
3. What are the class properties in this template?
4. Which variables are used that are not class properties?
5. Which class methods make use of a return value?
6. What do you think is meant by the term "positional argument"
7. How many positional arguments does the instance created on line 32 take?
8. How many positional arguments are expected on line 10?
9. How many positional arguments are expected on line 19?
10.  Notice the use of color.  ANSI escape codes can be used to add color/backgrounds to text.  See https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/273188

Task 1:
Use the comments in the template to create the program that will use the quadratic formula to find out all kinds of things about a quadratic equation in the format:
ax^2 + bx + c = 0
